					A vision of the Calendar project.

We want to create a calendar application targeted at professional (and amateur) -periodically employed people:
That is, people whose work schedules are periodically booked (Athletes, musicians, projectmanagers, ... ) 
hence forth named the client/clients.

The calendar should (apart from the obvious calendar functionality) cater for the specific needs of the client, namely: 
There are periods (for instance a whole week or two whole weeks) where a complete schedule is layed out for each day. 
These periods are seen as one coherent "clump" of time.

	(Athletes have long training/tournament periods. Musicians have tours.)

The calendar should be able to indicate the conherentness of such a period, that is, visually depict that it is a whole.
	( For instance by use of color)

	Each day during a period the client have a packed/tight programme: 
		The calendar should provide a means of - viewing a whole period 
		The calendar should provide a means of - make periods within periods
		The calendar should provide a means of - create a repeating daily/weekly schedule within a period
		The calendar should provide a means of - showing different sub-periods of a period
		The calendar should provide a means of - Integrate with other calendars (google, android, Iphone)
