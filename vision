					A vision of the Calendar project.

We want to create a calendar application targeted at professional and amateur -periodically employed people:
That is, people whose work schedule falls in periodically (musicians, Athletes, ).

The calendar should (apart from the obvious) cater for the specific needs of the above:

	Athletes have long coherent training/ tournament periods. The calendar should be able to draw these periods, that is, emphasize/depict these periods.
	For instance by drawing days/weeks the same color.
	
		Each day Athletes have a packed/tight programme. 
		The calendar should provide a means of ()  
		The calendar should provide a graphical representation of the programme during the day.
